## About

I build **automation-first data and AI systems**—tools that reduce manual effort, improve decision quality, and scale reliably.

My work focuses on applying **machine learning and large language models (LLMs)** where they meaningfully replace repetitive workflows or augment human decision-making. I care less about novelty and more about **systems that run daily without supervision**.

With a foundation in **data analytics and software engineering**, I approach AI problems end-to-end:  
*data ingestion → validation → modeling → evaluation → deployment → monitoring.*

## What I Build

- 🔁 **Automated data pipelines** that eliminate manual reporting and reconciliation  
- 📈 **ML workflows** that convert historical data into predictive signals  
- 🧠 **LLM-powered systems** for information extraction, summarization, and decision support  
- 📊 **Analytics layers** that connect model outputs to business-facing dashboards

## Applied AI & LLM Work

**LLM-driven pipelines**
- Text classification and structured data extraction  
- Summarization of long, noisy, real-world documents  
- Reasoning-assisted analysis over semi-structured data  

**Production-minded considerations**
- Prompt design vs programmatic control  
- Deterministic vs probabilistic behavior  
- Latency, cost, and reliability tradeoffs  
- Knowing when classical ML or rules outperform LLMs  

**Integration**
- Embedding LLM outputs into automated workflows  
- Combining LLM results with SQL- and Python-based analytics  
- Feeding downstream dashboards and reporting systems

## Automation & Systems Thinking

**Python-driven automation**
- Data cleaning, validation, and feature generation  
- Scheduled analytics and report generation  
- ETL pipelines across multiple data sources  

**System design principles**
- Reproducibility over ad-hoc scripts  
- Clear failure modes and observability  
- Minimal manual intervention  
- Metrics-first outputs

## How I Evaluate AI Systems

- Does it **measurably reduce human effort**?
- Are outputs **explainable and auditable**?
- Can the system **fail safely**?
- Is automation **cheaper and faster** than manual work?

If the answer is no, I simplify.
